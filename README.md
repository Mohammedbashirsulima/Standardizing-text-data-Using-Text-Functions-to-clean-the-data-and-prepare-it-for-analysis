Case study
A colleague, Lucas, has asked you to update a spreadsheet called Reseller Details that records details of Adventure Workâ€™s resellers in the United States. This information in the spreadsheet was downloaded from another system. The download process created several inconsistencies or errors within the data.

These errors include unnecessary spaces, the use of the wrong case, and entries that need to be joined together or split apart. 

You now need to add formulas to the worksheet to standardize the data so that it can be used for analysis.
